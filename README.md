**Git Test**

This repository has no source code, just a single README.md file used for testing git settings from various development settings.

it all works well--all commits are now signed.

Kleopatra installed.
And now it's configured as the default GPG in git.
And NOW, the original gpg key has been imported into Kleopatra!
How long does Kleopatra remember the passphrase?
Not long enough. :-(
Now, I've set it to 10 days!!
