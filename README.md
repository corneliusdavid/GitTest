**Git Test**

This repository has no source code, just a single README.md file used for testing git settings from various development settings.

it all works well--all commits are now signed.

Kleopatra installed.
And now it's configured as the default GPG in git.
And NOW, the original gpg key has been imported into Kleopatra!
How long does Kleopatra remember the passphrase?
Not long enough. :-(
Now, I've set it to 10 days!!
That wasn't good enough--also need to up the PIN caching timeout.
So many different settings in Kleoptra--documntation seems sparse. Tried another one....
This is asking even more often than before--how do I make it stop??
set PIN expiration in days from 10 downto 0
