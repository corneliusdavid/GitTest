**Git Test**

This repository has no source code, just a single README.md file used for testing git settings from various development settings.

First test is from my main Windows 10 development machine using Git Bash.

Second test is still from my main Windows 10 dev machine but will commit using SourceTree.

Third test is from Windows 10 vm used for the Keystone project.
Hopefully this new commit will be verified.
