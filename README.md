**Git Test**

This repository has no source code, just a single README.md file used for testing git settings from various development settings.

First test is from my main Windows 10 development machine using Git Bash.

Second test is still from my main Windows 10 dev machine but will commit using SourceTree.

Third test is from Windows 10 vm used for the Keystone project.

That worked--trying it from my main Win 10 VM now.

Laptop test--this is getting easier!

Testing from Win 10 VM again with different email

new test following instructions from my blog for a VM on VMware Fusion
almost have the instructions from memory now--Delphi 7 VM on VMWare Fusion
final test, mac vm using VMWare Fusion, with Delphi 10.4
